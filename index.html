                Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm on the path to becoming a skilled
                software engineer, fueled by my unwavering passion for technology and advocacy.

        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, I've had an inherent fascination with building things. Whether stacking blocks or tinkering with random things like disassembling and reassembling my pen, I felt like an engineer crafting a complex machine. For me, there was always a sense of joy in creating things. As I grew older, this interest naturally evolved, and when I stumbled upon coding, it felt like finding the perfect outlet for my creativity. What appealed to me most was that all I needed was a computer and a willingness to learn.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I've explored my interests and passions through various avenues. I've volunteered in different organizations, from marketing to accounting, but it was programming that truly captured my heart. For me, it wasn't just about writing lines of code; it was about crafting solutions, bringing ideas to life, and making a tangible impact.</p>
        <p>My journey in the world of technology has been marked by continuous exploration and learning. I've immersed myself in initiatives like Girls Who Code, Kode with Klossy, ASHS ProgVar, and UP Algo++, where I found a supportive community and endless opportunities to grow in this field. Participating in hackathons added an exhilarating dimension to my learning journey, pushing me to think creatively and collaborate effectively under pressure.</p>
        <p>Aside from this, my love for programming grew even larger after reading a book by Al Sweigart, in which he always emphasized the power of coding. From his essays, he made me realize how the deeper your comprehension of code is, the clearer you see the profound influence tech platforms and products wield over individuals' lives—be it through the incorporation or absence of particular functionalities, and whether these are deliberate or incidental holds huge significance.</p>
        <p>He made it clear that those in power are often desperate to maintain their control and are willing to use force—disproportionately against black people, Indigenous people, and minorities—to do so. From this essay, he urged me to be aware of the power I gained as I learned to code. He encouraged me to focus on projects that impact others positively and to refuse to work on projects who will use this power against others. This inspired me deeply, and I hope to inspire others as well. </p>
        <p>This message profoundly inspired me. Someday, I won’t work for just any company, it drove me to seek opportunities within companies I respect or even to create my own company in order to inspire others and contribute positively to society.</p>

        <p>In my case, what truly fuels my passion is the intersection of education and technology. Growing up in the Philippines, I've witnessed firsthand the disparities in access to quality education. It's an issue that resonates deeply with me, and I firmly believe that technology can be a powerful tool in bridging this gap. Whether it's through online learning platforms, interactive educational resources, or innovative teaching methods, technology has the potential to revolutionize education and empower learners from all backgrounds.</p>
        <p>My journey is still unfolding, but with each step, I'm driven by the conviction that technology can be a force for positive change. By harnessing its potential and channeling my passion into meaningful projects, I hope to contribute to building a more equitable and inclusive future.</p>
        
        <h3>What I’m Doing Right Now</h3>
        <p>Beyond my interest in technology, I like to believe that what truly defines me are the things I love. Outside of my interest in software, I love art, sports (chess, basketball, and football), films, photography, crocheting, and books. At the moment, I especially enjoy watching films, crocheting, and reading.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my summer crocheting. My grandmother taught me; she likes to crochet and make random items like holders for our water jugs so we can carry it easier with a handle. In turn, I wanted to do something for her too, so I made a potholder for when she’s cooking. From then on, I fell in love with the process of crocheting and it became an activity we enjoyed together.</p>
        <p>When it comes to films and reading, I enjoy horror films and jump scares, but I worry about jump scares when watching with my grandmother. So, I mostly watch comedy films now, especially the classic Filipino ones like "Praybeyt Benjamin" and "Ang Tanging Ina N'yong Lahat." I appreciate the symbolism in films and I tend to overanalyze them. What particularly intrigues me about most comedy films is their lighthearted nature yet contain an underlying sadness.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I've always loved reading. One of my favorite pastimes is getting lost in a good book and writing about it, which is why I've been wanting to start a blog for a while now.</p>
        <p>I have many interests and hope to find time for all of them. I see them as ways to express myself and share moments with those I love. :))</p>
